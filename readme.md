# BC Liberal 2016 Contributions

The BC Liberals released their campaign contributions for 2016 on [January 17th 2017](https://thetyee.ca/News/2017/01/14/BC-Liberals-Disclose-Donors-Early/). 

The data they released was in PDF format, completely unreadable. Under data you'll find a well-formated CSV of this data. 

You'll also find an Jupyter notebook of analysis. There's some interesting tidbits that weren't available without further analysis: such as aggregated contributions. 

This was also used to get back into using Pandas and to learn a bit about Altair.
